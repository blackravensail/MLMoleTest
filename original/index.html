            <p>
                Welcome! This website allows you to test an image of a mole against my machine learning model to see if it is malignant.
                To use it, take or choose an image, then Upload. The result should display at the top of the screen.
            </p>

            <p>
                Please allow for at least a minute and a half for the API to respond.
                The server first has to (if you choose) crop the image to the mole, then determine if it is malignant.
                If the text below the upload form doesn't change, then the API is down right now or swamped with requests.
                Please try again later if this is the case.
            </p>

            <p>
                The algorithm will then return its result.
                It may take a while to load. Just wait. <strong>Don't spam the button!</strong>
            </p>

                In case it isn't obvious, this prediction is not a replacement for a doctor.
                The model is not completly accurate (Usually about 80%).
                If you are worryed about a mole, please go see a doctor.
